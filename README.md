The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

## Objective
Exploratory analysis and build a predictive model that answers the question: "what types of people were most likely to survive?"

## Data
The data used in the analysis was sourced from the Kaggle competition platform. There are two similar datasets that include passenger information such as name, age, sex, socioeconomic class, and more. One dataset is titled `train.csv`, and the other is titled `test.csv`."
